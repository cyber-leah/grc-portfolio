# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 Study Guide

## Overview

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes applicable to any organization, regardless of size, sector, or maturity, to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe specific actions but links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls to achieve those outcomes.

## CSF Core Structure

The CSF Core is organized into six key Functions:

1. **Govern (GV):** Establishes and monitors the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.
2. **Identify (ID):** Develops an understanding of the organization's environment to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
3. **Protect (PR):** Implements safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services.
4. **Detect (DE):** Develops activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
5. **Respond (RS):** Takes action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
6. **Recover (RC):** Maintains plans for resilience and restores any capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

Each Function is further divided into Categories and Subcategories, detailing specific outcomes and security controls.

## CSF Profiles and Tiers

- **Profiles:** Represent the alignment of the CSF Core with the organization's requirements, risk tolerance, and resources. They help in identifying opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a "Current" Profile with a "Target" Profile.

- **Tiers:** Provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. The four Tiers are:
  - **Tier 1:** Partial
  - **Tier 2:** Risk Informed
  - **Tier 3:** Repeatable
  - **Tier 4:** Adaptive

## Online Resources and Implementation

NIST provides supplemental resources to assist organizations in implementing the CSF, including:

- **Informative References:** Specific sections of standards, guidelines, and practices mapped to the CSF Subcategories.
- **Implementation Examples:** Actionable steps that organizations can take to achieve the outcomes associated with each Subcategory.
- **Quick Start Guides (QSGs):** Tailored guidance for specific audiences to distill portions of the CSF into actionable "first steps."

## Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration

The CSF emphasizes the importance of:

- **Risk Communication:** Using the CSF to improve communication among stakeholders within and outside the organization regarding cybersecurity risk.
- **Integration with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM):** Aligning cybersecurity risk management with broader enterprise risk management processes.
- **Addressing Privacy and Supply Chain Risks:** Recognizing the relationship between cybersecurity and privacy risks and managing cybersecurity risks in supply chains.

## CSF Core Functions and Categories

Below is a detailed breakdown of the CSF Core Functions and their associated Categories:

### 1. Govern (GV)

Establishes and monitors the organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy.

- **GV.RM:** Risk Management Strategy
- **GV.RR:** Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities
- **GV.SC:** Supply Chain Risk Management

### 2. Identify (ID)

Develops an understanding of the organization's environment to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.

- **ID.AM:** Asset Management
- **ID.BE:** Business Environment
- **ID.RA:** Risk Assessment
- **ID.IM:** Improvement

### 3. Protect (PR)

Implements safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services.

- **PR.AA:** Identity Management, Authentication, and Access Control
- **PR.DS:** Data Security
- **PR.IP:** Information Protection Processes and Procedures
- **PR.MA:** Maintenance
- **PR.PS:** Platform Security
- **PR.IR:** Technology Infrastructure Resilience

### 4. Detect (DE)

Develops activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.

- **DE.CM:** Continuous Monitoring
- **DE.AE:** Adverse Event Analysis

### 5. Respond (RS)

Takes action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.

- **RS.MA:** Incident Management
- **RS.AN:** Incident Analysis
- **RS.CO:** Incident Response Reporting and Communication
- **RS.MI:** Incident Mitigation

### 6. Recover (RC)

Maintains plans for resilience and restores any capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

- **RC.RP:** Incident Recovery Plan Execution
- **RC.CO:** Incident Recovery Communication

## Conclusion

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 provides a comprehensive approach for organizations to manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. By understanding and implementing its Functions, Categories, and Subcategories, organizations can enhance their cybersecurity posture and resilience against cyber threats.
