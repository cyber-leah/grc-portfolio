## 🎯 Purpose

This guide helps federal agencies and organizations:
- Understand what **PII** is
- Evaluate the **risks of PII breaches**
- Apply **appropriate safeguards** to protect PII confidentiality
- Support compliance with **FISMA** and other privacy-related laws and regulations

## 🧾 What is PII?

> **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity — alone or when combined with other information.

### 🔎 Examples of PII

| Direct PII                | Indirect PII                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Name                      | Gender                                  |
| Social Security Number    | Zip code                                |
| Passport number           | Birthplace                              |
| Email address             | Employment information                  |
| Biometric identifiers     | Aggregated data that may re-identify individuals |

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### 🔐 PII Confidentiality Risk
Defined as the **likelihood and impact** of unauthorized disclosure of PII.

Risk factors include:
- **Sensitivity of the PII**
- **Context of use**
- **Quantity of PII collected or maintained**
- **Who has access and how it's shared**

---

### ⚙️ Safeguards for Protecting PII

NIST recommends a combination of:

| Control Type        | Examples |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Administrative**  | Policies, training, access reviews |
| **Technical**       | Encryption, access control, auditing |
| **Physical**        | Locked storage, facility access control |

---

### 🚨 PII Breach Response

Steps to take when a PII breach occurs:

1. **Report** the incident immediately
2. **Contain** the exposure
3. **Assess** the type and amount of PII involved
4. **Notify** affected individuals (if required)
5. **Mitigate** harm and strengthen safeguards

## 📘 Connection to Other NIST Publications

| Related Doc         | Relevance |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **SP 800-53 (PL, AC, AU, IR, PT families)** | Contains required privacy and confidentiality controls |
| **SP 800-37 Rev. 2** | Integrates privacy into the RMF process |
| **SP 800-171**       | Protects controlled unclassified information (CUI), including PII in non-federal systems |

## 🧠 Tips to Remember

- PII can be **directly identifying** or **indirectly identifying**
- **Context matters** — a data point may be PII in one use case but not another
- **Safeguards should be risk-based**, not one-size-fits-all
- Understand **breach response protocols** and how to communicate risk
