## üîç What is NIST SP 800-53?

NIST SP 800-53 provides a **catalog of security and privacy controls** for federal information systems and organizations. It is designed to help organizations:
- Manage **cybersecurity risk**
- Protect **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)**
- Meet compliance with **FISMA** and support the **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

---

## üîÑ Revision 5 Highlights

- First version to include **integrated privacy controls**
- Introduces **controls for systems processing personally identifiable information (PII)**
- Designed to be **framework-agnostic** and adaptable for both government and private-sector use
- Emphasizes **control outcomes**, not just technical implementations

---

## üß± Control Structure

Each control includes:

| Element            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Control ID**     | Unique identifier (e.g., AC-2, AU-6) |
| **Control Name**   | Descriptive title (e.g., Account Management) |
| **Control Text**   | The actual requirement or guideline |
| **Control Enhancements** | Optional add-ons for stronger protections |
| **Baseline Allocation** | Suggested control level based on LOW, MODERATE, or HIGH impact systems |
| **Discussion & Guidance** | Notes and clarification to help with implementation |

---

## üìö Control Families

There are **20 control families**, grouped by function:

| Family ID | Family Name                         | Purpose |

| CP        | Contingency Planning                | Disaster recovery and continuity |
| IA        | Identification and Authentication   | User and device authentication |
| IR        | Incident Response                   | Detecting and responding to incidents |
| MA        | Maintenance                         | System upkeep and secure servicing |
| MP        | Media Protection                    | Protecting data storage media |
| PE        | Physical and Environmental Protection | Securing physical environments |
| PL        | Planning                            | System security planning |
| PM        | Program Management                  | Org-wide risk and compliance management |
| PS        | Personnel Security                  | Vetting and offboarding staff |
| RA        | Risk Assessment                     | Identifying and evaluating risks |
| SA        | System and Services Acquisition     | Secure system procurement and development |
| SC        | System and Communications Protection | Network and data protections |
| SI        | System and Information Integrity    | Detecting and correcting system flaws |
| SR        | Supply Chain Risk Management        | Managing third-party and vendor risks |
| PT        | Privacy                             | Protecting PII and individual privacy |

## üìä Control Baselines

| Impact Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Low**      | Controls for systems with limited adverse impact |
| **Moderate** | Controls for systems with serious adverse impact |
| **High**     | Controls for systems with severe or catastrophic impact |

These levels are set during the **Categorize** step of the **RMF** using **FIPS 199** and **SP 800-60**.

## üîê Privacy Integration

SP 800-53 R5 adds dedicated **privacy controls** and emphasizes:
- **Minimization** of PII collection
- **Transparency** and **consent mechanisms**
- Data subject **rights and autonomy**
- Alignment with **Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs)**
