# Cybersecurity Processes and Technology

This folder contains work completed during my coursework at UMGC for the class **Cybersecurity Processes and Technology**. The class introduced fundamental cybersecurity concepts and practices, including risk identification, cyber defense strategies, compliance frameworks, and real-world implications of cyber threats in both supply chain and e-commerce contexts.

## Included Work

### ðŸ“„ Supply Chain Risk Analysis â€“ Sifers-Grayson
This paper explores hardware and software vulnerabilities in IT and cyber supply chains. It highlights the risks facing a defense contractor (Sifers-Grayson), including potential national security implications due to their work with DoD and DHS. The paper concludes with five actionable best practices to reduce risk.

### ðŸ“„ E-Commerce Risk Analysis â€“ Bay & Shore General Store
This analysis examines cybersecurity challenges faced by a small business expanding into e-commerce. It focuses on PCI DSS compliance, payment security, insider threats, and customer trust. It also applies four risk treatment strategiesâ€”accept, avoid, mitigate, and transferâ€”to real-world risk scenarios.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cyber and IT risk analysis
- PCI DSS awareness and application
- Vendor and e-commerce risk management
- Framework use (e.g., NIST SP 800-30, PCI DSS)
- Security recommendations for real-world business contexts
- GRC-related writing and documentation

This work reflects my growing interest in cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), and supports my goal of entering roles like vendor risk analyst, cybersecurity compliance analyst, or privacy analyst.
