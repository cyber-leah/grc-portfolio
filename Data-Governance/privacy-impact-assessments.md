## 🎯 What is a Privacy Impact Assessment?

A **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** is a process used to:
- Evaluate how an information system or project collects, uses, stores, and shares **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- Identify **privacy risks** early in system development or procurement
- Propose **safeguards and mitigation strategies** to reduce those risks
- Ensure **transparency and accountability**

---

## 🧠 Why PIAs Matter

PIAs help organizations:
- Comply with **privacy laws and frameworks** (e.g., FISMA, CCPA, GDPR)
- Build **trust** with users by being transparent about data use
- Document how privacy risks are **assessed, mitigated, and monitored**

## 📋 Core Components of a PIA

| Section | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **System Overview** | Describes the system or project being assessed |
| **Information Type** | Identifies what PII is being collected and processed |
| **Purpose of Collection** | Explains why the data is collected and how it will be used |
| **Data Flow** | Diagrams or describes where the data comes from, where it goes, and who can access it |
| **Access Controls & Safeguards** | Details technical and policy protections in place |
| **Risk Assessment** | Identifies potential privacy risks and their impact |
| **Mitigation Measures** | Lists steps to reduce or eliminate risks |
