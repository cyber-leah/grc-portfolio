## üìò Key Frameworks and Compliance Guidelines

### 1. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **Purpose:** Protects patient health information and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI).
- **Key Components:**
  - **Privacy Rule:** Regulates how ePHI is used and disclosed.
  - **Security Rule:** Establishes standards for safeguarding ePHI.
  - **Breach Notification Rule:** Outlines breach response and notification procedures.

### 2. HITRUST
- **Purpose:** Provides a comprehensive security framework that integrates regulatory requirements from multiple frameworks (e.g., HIPAA, ISO, NIST).
- **Components:**
  - HITRUST CSF (Common Security Framework)
  - HITRUST Assurance Program
  - HITRUST Certification

### 3. HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act)
- **Purpose:** Promotes the adoption of health information technology and strengthens HIPAA privacy and security protections.
- **Enforcement:** Increases penalties for non-compliance and mandates breach notifications.
- **Focus Areas:** Breach notification, data encryption, business associate agreements.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Compliance
- **Risk Assessments:** Utilize the [Security Risk Assessment Tool](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/privacy-security-and-hipaa/security-risk-assessment-tool) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt ePHI both at rest and in transit.
- **Access Controls:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit data access.
- **Training and Awareness:** Conduct regular training for employees on HIPAA and data protection.
- **Incident Response:** Develop and test incident response plans for potential breaches.
