## üîê Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)

WPA3 was introduced in 2018 to address weaknesses found in WPA2. It provides enhanced wireless security through stronger encryption methods and better protections against brute-force attacks.

### Key Features of WPA3:

- **Protected Management Frames (PMF):**  
  Enhances wireless security by protecting multicast transmissions and shielding wireless packets against Initialization Vector (IV) attacks.

- **WPA3-Enterprise:**  
  Offers stronger encryption (compared to WPA2‚Äôs 128-bit) using **Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE)** for secure initial key exchange. Ideal for use in government and finance sectors.

- **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals):**  
  Replaces WPA2-PSK with a more secure handshake. Uses **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)** and **Dragonfly** key exchange to protect session keys‚Äîeven if one is compromised, past communications remain secure.

- **Wi-Fi Easy Connect:**  
  Simplifies secure connection for IoT and smart devices by allowing them to connect using a QR code instead of entering a passphrase manually.

- **Wi-Fi Enhanced Open:**  
  Adds encryption to open Wi-Fi networks in public places (hotels, caf√©s, airports), using PMF to prevent eavesdropping‚Äîeven without a password.

### üß† Summary

WPA3 is designed to:
- Improve wireless encryption and integrity
- Protect against brute-force and IV attacks
- Provide better security for both enterprise and public environments
- Secure connections for IoT and smart devices
