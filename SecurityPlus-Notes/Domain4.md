# Security+ Domain 4: Security Operations


# Hardening Targets

Hardening targets is a proactive approach to cybersecurity that reduces vulnerabilities, mitigates risk, and strengthens an organization’s overall security posture. Below is a summary of different targets and methods used to harden them effectively.

---

## 📱 Mobile Devices
- Enforce strong passwords or biometric authentication
- Enable encryption for device data
- Keep mobile OS and apps up to date

---

## 🖥️ Workstations
- Use host-based firewalls
- Deploy antivirus/antimalware software
- Apply least privilege policies to restrict unnecessary user access

---

## 🔀 Switches
- Change default login credentials
- Use port security and disable unused ports
- Implement:
  - **VLANs** for network segmentation
  - **SSH** for secure remote management
  - **SNMP** security for monitoring
  - **ACLs** to control traffic flow
- Apply firmware updates and enable network traffic monitoring

---

## 📡 Routers
- Change default credentials
- Enable firewalls and disable remote management
- Use **SSH** for remote access
- Keep firmware updated
- Apply ACLs and enable SNMP logging

---

## ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure
- Enforce strong access controls
- Use encryption
- Perform regular security assessments

---

## 🖥️ Servers
- Apply security patches regularly
- Use robust access controls
- Enforce the principle of least privilege
- Enable logging and auditing

---

## ⚙️ ICS/SCADA (Industrial Control Systems)
- Use network segmentation
- Enhance physical security
- Apply regular security updates

---

## 🧠 Embedded Systems
- Minimize unnecessary services
- Follow secure coding practices
- Apply security updates during development

---

## ⏱️ Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- Use encryption and secure boot
- Perform regular security evaluations
- Change default passwords for each application

---

## 🌐 IoT Devices
- Change default settings and passwords
- Apply firmware updates regularly
- Use device authentication and network segmentation
- Keep software up to date

---

## 📶 Wireless Access Points
- Change default password and SSID
- Disable SSID broadcasting
- Use WPA3 encryption
- Implement MAC filtering for access control

---

## ✅ Summary

Hardening is about reducing risk and limiting exposure. Whether you're securing endpoints, infrastructure, or embedded devices, it's essential to:
- Change default configurations
- Apply least privilege
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Use strong access controls
