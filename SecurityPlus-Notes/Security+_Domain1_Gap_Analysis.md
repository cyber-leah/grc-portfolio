**Security+ Domain 1: Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities**

## What is Gap Analysis?

Gap analysis is a strategic process used to evaluate an organization’s current security posture against industry standards, frameworks, or best practices. It helps identify “gaps” between the current state and the desired state of security.

## Key Steps

- **Assessment**  
  Understand current security controls—policies, procedures, technologies, etc.

- **Benchmarking**  
  Compare those controls against external standards like NIST, ISO, or regulatory requirements.

- **Identification**  
  Pinpoint specific areas where the organization is not meeting the desired baseline or control requirements.

- **Prioritization**  
  Rank the gaps based on risk—focus first on the ones most likely to be exploited or that would have the biggest impact.

- **Remediation Strategy**  
  Create and implement actionable steps to close the most critical gaps and improve the organization’s security posture.

## Why It Matters

Gap analysis isn’t a one-and-done task—it should be **iterative**. As new threats emerge and standards evolve, regular gap assessments help organizations keep their security practices aligned with the current threat landscape.

This process is especially important in GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) roles like:
- Risk Analyst
- Compliance Analyst
- Vendor Risk Manager
