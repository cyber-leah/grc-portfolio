## Regulated Data

Certain data types are governed by strict regulations due to their sensitivity. These include:

### 1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
- Uniquely identifies a person (e.g., SSN, biometric data, driver's license, phone number, email, employee records).

### 2. **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
- Health-related data (e.g., medical history, diseases, treatments, test results like X-rays or MRIs).

### 3. **Financial Data**
- Includes bank account details, card info, and transactions.
- Regulated by laws related to privacy, anti-money laundering, and fraud prevention.

### 4. **Legal Data**
- Pertains to legal proceedings, including court cases.
- Highly confidential and subject to privacy regulations.

### 5. **Intellectual Property (IP)**
- Includes creative innovations such as trade secrets, patents, copyrights.
- Regulated to protect ownership and usage rights.

### 6. **Consumer Data**
- Includes purchase histories, preferences, online behavior.
- Protected by privacy and consumer protection laws.

### 7. **Government Data**
- Collected and handled by government agencies.
- Stringently regulated for access, sharing, and disposal (e.g., contractors must follow strict protocols).

### 8. **Trade Secrets**
- Confidential business information with competitive advantage.
- Protected via **NDAs** and employment contracts + technical access restrictions.

### 9. **Customer Data**
- Includes customer-specific information and may involve sensitive personal data.
- Also includes data on account managers.
- Should be handled with strict privacy controls.

### 10. **Proprietary Data**
- Company-specific data overlapping with IP and trade secrets.
- Includes research and product development information.

### 11. **Biometric Data**
- Data from fingerprints, facial recognition, or other biometric systems.
