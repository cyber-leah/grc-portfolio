## üìò Core Framework Documents

The information security framework provides a structured approach to managing and enforcing security in an organization. It consists of several key document types:

| Document Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Policies** | Formal statements that outline goals, principles, and guidelines to achieve specific objectives. |
| **Standards** | Define specific requirements for a process, product, or service. |
| **Guidelines** | Non-mandatory recommendations and best practices for achieving goals. |
| **Procedures** | Step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks or processes. |
| **Baselines** | Minimum security requirements that systems or processes must meet. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Developing Governance Documents

Here are the general steps used to create security documents:

1. **Identify the Scope and Purpose**  
   Determine what the document will cover and why it's needed.

2. **Research and Review**  
   Look into relevant laws, industry standards, and existing documents to ensure consistency and compliance.

3. **Draft the Document**  
   Create clear, actionable, and goal-aligned drafts using best practices.

4. **Review and Approval**  
   Gather feedback from subject matter experts and leadership before finalizing.

5. **Implementation and Communication**  
   Share with all relevant employees and develop training to support adoption.

6. **Review and Update**  
   Periodically revisit documents to keep them relevant and aligned with evolving risks and regulations.

## üîê Preparing a Password Policy

Key elements of a strong password policy:

- **Password Requirements**: Set rules for length, complexity, and expiration.
- **Usage Guidelines**: Prohibit sharing and enforce unique passwords.
- **Storage and Transmission**: Require encryption and secure transmission.
- **Change/Reset Guidelines**: Define when and how users should update passwords.
- **Communicate the Policy**: Train employees and ensure awareness.
- **Monitor Compliance**: Continuously evaluate adherence and make improvements.

## üö® Creating an Incident Response Procedure

Steps for building a practical response process:

1. **Define Incident Types**  
   Include threats like unauthorized access, malware, and data breaches.

2. **Assign Roles and Responsibilities**  
   Identify who does what during an incident‚ÄîIT, legal, compliance, and leadership.

3. **Develop Detailed Steps**  
   Include:
   - Initial response and containment
   - Investigation and root cause analysis
   - Recovery and reporting

4. **Report**  
   Ensure documentation of the incident and reporting to management.

5. **Communicate**  
   Distribute procedures to teams and make expectations clear.

6. **Review**  
   Periodically evaluate the process to improve effectiveness.

## üß† Final Note

Organizations don't always need to build every framework from scratch. Often, they adapt or follow existing standards based on their industry (e.g., PCI DSS for finance, HIPAA for healthcare). The chosen standard often depends on location, scope, risk level, and available resources.

*Tip: As you learn more frameworks like NIST, ISO, or COBIT, map them back to these core documents to understand how they guide policy creation and compliance efforts.*
