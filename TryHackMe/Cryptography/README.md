# Cybersecurity in Government Organizations

This folder contains writing samples and briefing papers from my class **Cybersecurity in Government Organizations**. Each project explores different dimensions of cybersecurity in the public sectorâ€”from cloud security frameworks to digital trust and open data risks.

## Included Work

### ðŸ“„ Digital Trust and Cyber Risk â€“ Newsletter Article
A mock newsletter article exploring how the shift to digital government services affects public trust, data privacy, and cyber risk. The piece examines frameworks like NIST SP 800-37, FedRAMP, and ISO/IEC 27001 and highlights lessons from the MOVEit breach.

### ðŸ“„ Open Data Briefing Statement
An academic briefing that addresses the risks of publishing sensitive or detailed datasets through open government portals. It covers threats related to infrastructure maps, cyber incident disclosures, and federal financial data, with safeguards from NIST RMF and OMB Circular A-137.

### ðŸ“„ FedRAMP and Play #11: Strengthening Security in Digital Government Services
This briefing outlines the purpose and value of FedRAMP for securing cloud-based digital services in the federal government. It also explains how Play #11 from the Digital Services Playbook helps agencies embed privacy and security into service design from the start.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Policy and risk communication
- Framework fluency (FedRAMP, NIST RMF, OMB A-137, ISO 27001)
- Government cybersecurity awareness
- Secure cloud adoption principles
- Technical writing for leadership and public audiences

This collection reinforces my interest in GRC and shows my ability to translate technical frameworks into plain-language recommendations for decision-makers in the public sector.
