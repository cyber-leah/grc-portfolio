# 🧩 GRC and Identity & Access Management (IAM) - The Relationship

This guide explores how **IAM** directly supports Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) functions, helping organizations secure access, demonstrate accountability, and pass audits.

## 🔐 IAM’s Role in GRC

IAM ensures:
- **Only authorized users** access sensitive systems and data
- **User activities are traceable** and logged
- Access to systems aligns with **least privilege** and **segregation of duties**
- Access policies can be reviewed, enforced, and audited

## 🔍 GRC Use Cases Powered by IAM

| GRC Function      | IAM Contribution |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Governance**   | Role definitions, access policy enforcement |
| **Risk**         | Minimizes insider threats, orphaned accounts, excessive access |
| **Compliance**   | Supports standards like HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, SOX |
| **Audit**        | Enables user activity logs, access review reports, provisioning/deprovisioning tracking |

## ✅ IAM Features that Support GRC

- **Access Certifications**: Review who has access to what — and why
- **User Lifecycle Management**: Ensures access is removed when no longer needed
- **Logging & SIEM**: Creates audit trails for investigations and compliance checks
- **RBAC/ABAC**: Enforces least privilege based on roles or attributes
- **MFA**: Strengthens authentication for sensitive systems
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Reduces risk from password fatigue and credential sprawl

## 🧠 Real-World Impact

- Auditors can **verify access control effectiveness**
- Risk teams can **identify high-risk access combinations**
- Compliance officers can **map IAM policies** to regulatory requirements
