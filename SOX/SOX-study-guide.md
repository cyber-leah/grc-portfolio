# SOX Study Guide

---

## 1. Overview of SOX

**Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)** is a U.S. federal law that mandates practices in financial recordkeeping and reporting for corporations to prevent fraud.

### Key Sections:
- **Section 302** – Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports
- **Section 404** – Management Assessment of Internal Controls
- **Section 409** – Real-time Issuer Disclosures

SOX applies to all publicly traded companies and their financial reporting systems.

## 2. Understanding Business Process Flows

### What is a Process Flow?

A **process flow** is a diagram or map that outlines how transactions or events flow through a business process (e.g., procure-to-pay, order-to-cash).

### Why it's Important for SOX:

- Helps auditors and compliance officers understand how financial data is generated and recorded.
- Supports control identification and testing.

### Key Steps to Map a Process Flow:

1. Identify the triggering event (e.g., customer order).
2. Document all process steps in order.
3. Include systems, people, and documents used.
4. Highlight any approval or validation points.

Example:  
**Procure-to-Pay (P2P)**  
1. Purchase requisition →  
2. Purchase order →  
3. Goods receipt →  
4. Invoice receipt →  
5. Payment

## 3. Process Narratives

### What is a Process Narrative?

A **process narrative** is a written description of a business process that includes:
- Roles involved
- Systems used
- Steps in the process
- Risks and controls

### Purpose:
- Helps external/internal auditors understand how processes operate.
- Links directly to SOX Section 404 testing.

### Tips for Writing Narratives:
- Use clear, concise language.
- Include relevant systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle).
- Describe each process step and responsible party.

## 4. Risk and Control Matrices (RCMs)

### What is an RCM?

An **RCM** identifies risks in a process and documents the corresponding controls that mitigate those risks.

### Components of an RCM:

| Risk ID | Risk Description        | Control Activity       | Control Type | Frequency | Control Owner |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| R1      | Unauthorized payments   | Dual approval of POs   | Preventative | Ongoing   | AP Manager     |

### Control Types:
- **Preventive** – Stops errors/fraud before they occur (e.g., access controls).
- **Detective** – Identifies issues after they occur (e.g., reconciliations).
- **Manual** vs. **Automated** – Based on how the control is performed.

## 5. IT Platforms and Financial Reporting

### IT's Role in SOX:

SOX compliance requires controls around financial systems and data integrity.

### Key Areas to Focus On:

- **General IT Controls (GITCs):**
  - Access Management (e.g., least privilege)
  - Change Management
  - Backup and Recovery
  - Segregation of Duties

- **Application Controls:**
  - Data validation
  - Input/processing/output controls
  - Automated calculations (e.g., payroll systems)

### Common Financial Systems:
- ERP Systems: SAP, Oracle Financials, NetSuite
- Reporting Tools: Hyperion, Workiva

## 6. SOX Compliance Framework

### Steps to Maintain SOX Compliance:

1. **Scoping** – Identify which accounts/processes are material to financial reporting.
2. **Documentation** – Create process flows and narratives.
3. **Risk Assessment** – Identify risks that could lead to material misstatements.
4. **Control Identification** – Map controls to risks.
5. **Testing** – Verify control design and operating effectiveness.
6. **Remediation** – Address deficiencies or weaknesses.
7. **Reporting** – Certify and report internal control effectiveness (Section 404).

### Tools Used in SOX Programs:

- GRC Platforms: AuditBoard, Workiva, LogicGate
- Collaboration: Confluence, SharePoint
- Issue Tracking: Jira, ServiceNow

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding how data flows and is controlled is critical to SOX.
- Narratives and RCMs are essential documentation for audits.
- IT plays a big role—both in enabling controls and being a risk area.
- SOX is not a one-time event—it’s an ongoing process of control and compliance.
