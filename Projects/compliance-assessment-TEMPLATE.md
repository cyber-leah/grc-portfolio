# For Mock Compliance Assessment Practice

## 🧠 What This Is
This file is for practicing ethical, public-facing compliance assessments of real or fictional companies. The goal is to simulate what a GRC analyst or auditor might do during a controls review, policy evaluation, or risk analysis—**without needing access to internal systems or confidential data.**

---

## ✅ Ethical Guidelines
- Only use **publicly available information** (privacy policies, terms of service, compliance webpages, etc.)
- Clearly state when something is a **simulation or assumption**
- Do **not** claim or imply unauthorized access or official conclusions
- Keep your work professional and constructive

---

## 🧰 Frameworks You Can Use
Structure your assessments using:
- NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5)
- NIST CSF
- ISO/IEC 27001
- SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria
- HIPAA Security Rule (for healthcare orgs)
- PCI DSS (if payment data is involved)

---

## 📋 Sample Template
**Company/Target (public or fictional):**  
**Framework Used:**  
**Focus Area:** (e.g., Access Control, Risk Assessment, Data Protection)  

### Observations:
- Does the company provide a public privacy policy? Cookie policy?
- Do they reference GDPR, HIPAA, or other frameworks?
- Is there any indication of third-party compliance (e.g., SOC 2 reports)?
- What risks are visible based on what they disclose?

### Gaps or Recommendations (Hypothetical):
- Example: "The company has no public cookie opt-out mechanism, which may create GDPR noncompliance risk."

### Reflection:
- What did you learn?
- How would you approach this differently with access to internal policies?

---

## 🧪 Practice Ideas
- Review the privacy policies of 2–3 companies and compare them to NIST or ISO controls
- Simulate a gap assessment for a fictional company handling healthcare data
- Try mapping a company’s trust & security webpage to SOC 2 criteria
