This folder contains study materials and resources related to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Version 2.0.

## Contents

- `nist-csf-2.0-study-guide.md`: A structured and simplified breakdown of the NIST CSF 2.0 Core Functions, Categories, and implementation insights.

## Purpose

This is part of my GRC learning portfolio, where I document and summarize key cybersecurity frameworks and concepts. This folder will expand over time to include:

- Implementation examples
- Mapping between CSF and other frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001)
- Practical use cases and exercises
