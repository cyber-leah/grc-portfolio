# 🧾 GAO FISCAM (OIG-15-1) Study Guide  
**Title:** *Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM)*  
**Publisher:** U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)  
**PDF:** [GAO OIG-15-1](https://www.gao.gov/products/oig-15-1)

## 🎯 Purpose

The FISCAM provides a **methodology for evaluating information system (IS) controls** during financial and performance audits. It is used primarily by federal auditors (e.g., OIG, GAO) but contains valuable knowledge for anyone assessing **IT general controls (ITGCs)** or conducting compliance audits.

---

## 📚 Key Objectives

- Evaluate if IS controls **adequately safeguard data and systems**  
- Support auditors in assessing **data integrity, confidentiality, and availability**  
- Identify **control deficiencies** that could impact financial reporting or operational reliability

---

## 🧱 FISCAM Control Domains

FISCAM organizes system controls into **six major domains**, categorized as either general or application controls:

| Domain                    | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Security Management**   | Establishing policies, assigning responsibilities, and conducting risk assessments |
| **Access Controls**       | Ensuring only authorized individuals/systems access resources |
| **Configuration Management** | Managing baseline configurations and changes to system components |
| **Segregation of Duties** | Preventing single users from having incompatible responsibilities |
| **Contingency Planning**  | Ensuring systems can recover from disruption or loss |
| **Application Controls**  | Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and validity of transactions in apps |

---

## 🛠 How It’s Used

FISCAM provides:

- **Evaluation Attributes** for each domain  
- **Audit procedures** and questions  
- **Assessment criteria** that can inform audit reports and control recommendations  

Auditors often combine FISCAM with:
- GAO’s *Green Book* (internal control standards)  
- NIST SP 800-53 (for control mapping)

---

## 🔗 Relevance to GRC & Private Sector

While FISCAM is written for federal use, it supports:

- **ITGC evaluations** used in SOX and SOC audits  
- Understanding of control domains found in **ISO 27001**, **NIST CSF**, and **SP 800-53**  
- **Risk-based control testing** and documentation

---

## 🧠 Tips to Remember

- FISCAM = control-focused + audit-friendly  
- Knowing this framework gives GRC pros a leg up in audit-prep and compliance  
- It's a great companion to NIST RMF when evaluating system-level control effectiveness
