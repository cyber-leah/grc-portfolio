## 🧾 What is FISMA?

**FISMA** stands for the **Federal Information Security Modernization Act**. It is a **U.S. federal law** originally enacted in **2002** and updated in **2014**. Its purpose is to:

- Protect government **information systems**
- Standardize cybersecurity practices across **federal agencies**
- Require the implementation of risk-based **information security programs**

> 🔑 FISMA mandates the use of **NIST standards** to protect information and ensure compliance across all federal executive agencies.

---

## 🧠 Why FISMA Matters

- It applies to **federal agencies** and **contractors** handling government data
- It is enforced through **audits and annual reporting**
- Non-compliance can lead to loss of contracts, funding, or reputational damage

> FISMA is also a driver for adopting **NIST SP 800-53**, **NIST SP 800-37**, and the **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**.

## 🛠 Key Components of a FISMA Program

Under FISMA, organizations must implement an **information security program** that includes:

1. **Risk Assessments**
2. **Security Policies and Procedures**
3. **Security Controls (per NIST SP 800-53)**
4. **Periodic Testing and Evaluations**
5. **Remediation and Continuous Monitoring**
6. **Security Awareness Training**
7. **Incident Response and Reporting**
8. **Annual FISMA Compliance Reporting to OMB**

| **SP 800-53**          | Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems  
| **SP 800-37**          | Risk Management Framework (RMF)  
| **SP 800-60**          | Categorization of Federal Information and Systems (ties into FIPS 199)  
| **FIPS 199**           | Categorization of Information Systems (based on CIA triad)  
| **FIPS 200**           | Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Systems  
| **NIST CSF**           | Voluntary framework often referenced for alignment

## 🔎 Key Terms to Know

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **ISMS** | Information Security Management System  
| **System Authorization (ATO)** | Official approval to operate a system based on risk acceptance  
| **Control Assessment** | Testing and evaluating implemented security controls  
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Ongoing security assessment and incident detection  
| **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** | Document outlining how known security weaknesses will be addressed

## ✅ FISMA Compliance Process (Simplified)

1. **Categorize** the information system (FIPS 199 / NIST SP 800-60)  
2. **Select** appropriate controls (NIST SP 800-53)  
3. **Implement** security controls  
4. **Assess** controls for effectiveness (Security Control Assessment)  
5. **Authorize** the system (ATO issued by authorizing official)  
6. **Monitor** continuously for threats and compliance

---

## 🧭 Who Enforces FISMA?

- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)**: Oversees annual reporting  
- **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**: Provides implementation assistance  
- **Inspectors General (IGs)**: Conduct independent audits

## 📌 FISMA & GRC Roles

| Role | How FISMA Applies |
|------|-------------------|
| **Risk Analyst** | Must understand RMF and how controls are selected and assessed  
| **Compliance Analyst** | Tracks implementation of NIST SP 800-53 and policy alignment  
| **Security Assessor** | Performs audits, POA&M tracking, and documentation  
| **Federal Contractor** | Must ensure systems meet FISMA-related compliance expectations  

---

## ✅ TL;DR

- **FISMA is law** — not just a framework  
- It drives the adoption of **NIST standards** for information security  
- It applies to all **federal agencies and contractors**  
- It requires **risk-based, auditable security programs**  
- GRC professionals in federal and government-adjacent roles must understand how to **apply and assess FISMA requirements**
