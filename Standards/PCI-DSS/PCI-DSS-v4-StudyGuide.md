## 📖 What is PCI DSS?

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** is a global set of **security standards** developed to ensure that all entities processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information maintain a **secure environment**. It is managed by the **PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of PCI DSS

- **Safeguard cardholder data**
- **Maintain trust** with consumers and partners
- **Ensure compliance** with industry security requirements
- **Reduce fraud** and data breaches

## 🔑 PCI DSS v4.0 Requirements at a Glance

PCI DSS v4.0 is organized into **12 core requirements**, grouped under 6 high-level goals:

---

### 🔐 1. Build and Maintain a Secure Network and Systems

- **Requirement 1:** Install and maintain network security controls  
  *→ Secure firewalls, routers, segmentation controls*

- **Requirement 2:** Apply secure configurations to all system components  
  *→ Hardened baseline configs for all devices and applications*

---

### 🛡️ 2. Protect Account Data

- **Requirement 3:** Protect stored account data  
  *→ Masking, encryption, access restrictions*

- **Requirement 4:** Protect cardholder data with strong cryptography during transmission  
  *→ Use TLS, VPNs, secure protocols (HTTPS, SSH)*

---

### 🔍 3. Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program

- **Requirement 5:** Protect all systems and networks from malicious software  
  *→ Antivirus, EDR, malware detection, email filtering*

- **Requirement 6:** Develop and maintain secure systems and software  
  *→ Patch management, secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning*

---

### 👤 4. Implement Strong Access Control Measures

- **Requirement 7:** Restrict access to system components and cardholder data by business need to know  
  *→ Role-based access control (RBAC), least privilege*

- **Requirement 8:** Identify users and authenticate access to system components  
  *→ MFA, unique IDs, centralized authentication*

- **Requirement 9:** Restrict physical access to cardholder data  
  *→ Door locks, badges, video surveillance, secure server rooms*

---

### 🔁 5. Regularly Monitor and Test Networks

- **Requirement 10:** Log and monitor all access to system components and cardholder data  
  *→ Centralized logging, audit trails, log review*

- **Requirement 11:** Test security of systems and networks regularly  
  *→ Pen testing, vulnerability scans, change detection*

---

### 🧾 6. Maintain an Information Security Policy

- **Requirement 12:** Support information security with organizational policies and programs  
  *→ Risk assessments, security awareness, incident response, policy governance*

---

## 🆕 What’s New in PCI DSS v4.0?

- **Customized Approach:**  
  Flexibility to implement controls in new ways, provided the intent is met and documented.

- **Expanded Use of MFA:**  
  MFA is required for **all access** into the **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**, not just admin accounts.

- **More Risk-Based Flexibility:**  
  Organizations can use **Targeted Risk Analysis** to define frequencies for controls (e.g., reviews, scans).

- **Increased Logging Requirements:**  
  Enhanced expectations for event logging, retention, and monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices for Implementation

- **Define Your Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**  
  Clearly identify all people, processes, and systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data.

- **Ensure Segmentation**  
  Use network segmentation to reduce scope and isolate the CDE from the rest of the environment.

- **Use Strong Encryption**  
  Encrypt data at rest and in transit using industry-accepted algorithms (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.2+).

- **Manage Vendor Risk**  
  Ensure third-party service providers meet PCI DSS compliance and sign agreements.

- **Train Your Staff**  
  Conduct role-specific training and general security awareness annually (at minimum).

- **Test and Monitor Continuously**  
  Use automated tools where possible to detect, log, and respond to anomalies in real-time.

## 💡 Study Tips

✅ Focus on **understanding the intent** of each requirement  
✅ Memorize the **12 core requirements**  
✅ Compare **v4.0 vs. v3.2.1** changes (many job interviews ask this)  
✅ Use **visuals** to map how controls connect (CDE, network segmentation, etc.)  
✅ Practice explaining how PCI DSS supports **risk reduction** and **compliance goals**

## 🧠 PCI DSS & GRC Connections

- **Risk Management:** PCI DSS encourages risk-based decision-making and periodic risk assessments.
- **Audit Readiness:** Detailed logging and documentation support internal and external audits.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Requirement 12 aligns directly with governance and security program maturity.
- **Third-Party Risk:** Requirements for service providers align with vendor risk management practices.
