# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – Learning Hub

This folder is part of my GRC portfolio and contains study materials, summaries, and practical tools related to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, including cross-framework comparisons and learning aids.

## 📚 Contents

- `nist-csf-2.0-study-guide.md` — Summary of the NIST CSF 2.0 Core Functions, Categories, Tiers, and implementation tools.
- `csf-vs-nist-ai-rmf.md` — Comparison between NIST CSF and NIST AI RMF (coming soon).
- `flashcards-csf.md` — CSF terminology and concept flashcards (coming soon).
- Visuals/
  - `csf-risk-functions-overview.png` (coming soon)

## 🧭 Purpose

This folder helps me (and others) study the NIST CSF in preparation for roles in cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance. CSF is widely used in both government and private industry, and understanding its structure and use cases is critical for entry-level GRC professionals.

## 🔁 Future Additions

- Scenario-based practice questions
- Mappings to other frameworks (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Risk assessment mini-project using CSF Core
