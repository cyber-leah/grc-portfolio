## The Digital Shift in Government Services

As COVID-19 fades in the rearview mirror, one thing is clear: government services have gone digital, and there‚Äôs no turning back. What started as a temporary public health measure has become a permanent fix, offering greater convenience and efficiency for citizens and government agencies. However, with this convenience comes new challenges. As agencies continue expanding digital services, they must address growing cybersecurity risks to protect sensitive data and maintain public trust.

## Online Government: A Trust Issue?

With the advancement of government service digitization, time-consuming tasks that leave you questioning all your life choices, like renewing your driver‚Äôs license, are now available online. This reduction in inefficiency, whether at the DMV or another agency, helps ease the workload for government employees while reducing the pain for citizens.

In a 2022 survey of 35,000 individuals, 54% agreed that going online for government help was easier (Jazayeri, 2024). However, ease of use isn‚Äôt the only thing people care about. The **Connected Government** report found that **trust** in government and **data privacy** remain top concerns. In a survey spanning 36 countries, 87% of citizens said a *‚Äúgreat‚Äù digital experience would increase their trust in government* (Jazayeri, 2024).

That trust, however, depends on how well agencies protect sensitive personal data. Without strong cybersecurity, even the most user-friendly services risk losing public confidence.

## Digital Services and the Growing Cyber Risk

The rapid shift to digital services during COVID-19 prioritized accessibility, sometimes at the expense of security. But one does not simply create a service and expect no zero-day attacks.

Cybercriminals continuously search for vulnerabilities. A prime example is the **MOVEit breach**, where attackers exploited a zero-day SQL injection flaw (**CVE-2023-34362**) to steal sensitive data before organizations could respond (Ford, 2023).

That breach is one of many. Government agencies now face:
- A larger digital attack surface
- More phishing attacks targeting employees and citizens
- Ransomware threats holding public data hostage

Federal, state, and local agencies are all vulnerable, and the stakes have never been higher.

## Mitigating Risks with Best Practices

To minimize cybersecurity risks, agencies must meet them head-on with best practices:

- **Segmented networks** to reduce the attack surface  
- **Regular audits and assessments**  
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**  
- **Zero Trust Architecture**

Supporting frameworks include:

### üõ° NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2
A risk management framework that guides agencies through control selection, risk assessment, and continuous monitoring. It embeds security throughout the system lifecycle (Joint Task Force, 2018).

### ‚òÅÔ∏è FedRAMP
The federal standard for secure cloud adoption. It ensures third-party providers meet strict requirements for use in federal environments (GSA, 2024).

### üåê ISO/IEC 27001
A globally recognized framework that helps organizations establish and maintain an information security management system (ISMS), including policy creation, monitoring, and data protection (IT Governance, n.d.).

## Smooth Sailing Ahead: Securing Digital Government for the Future

The shift to digital government services began as a pandemic response but is here to stay. Now, it‚Äôs up to agencies to rise to the challenge of safeguarding data and restoring public trust.

Cybersecurity must be more than a compliance checkbox‚Äîit must be a commitment to secure, ethical, and citizen-centric digital governance.

The challenge is clear: **will your agency rise to meet it?**
