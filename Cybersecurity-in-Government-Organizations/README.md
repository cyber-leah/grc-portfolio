# Cybersecurity in Government Organizations

This folder contains coursework and writing samples from my class **Cybersecurity in Government Organizations**. This course explored the increasing complexity of cybersecurity in federal, state, and local government operations—especially in the wake of digital transformation initiatives.

## Included Work

### 📄 Digital Trust and Cyber Risk – Newsletter Article
This mock newsletter article discusses the lasting digital shift in government services since the COVID-19 pandemic. It explores how public trust and data privacy are impacted by the digitization of services. Real-world examples, like the MOVEit breach, are used to illustrate risks. The piece also highlights cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST SP 800-37, FedRAMP, and ISO/IEC 27001, showing how agencies can build secure, citizen-centric systems.

### 📄 Open Data Briefing Statement
This briefing raises awareness about the risks associated with open data initiatives at the federal and state levels. It examines how critical infrastructure data, cyber incident datasets, and federal financial transparency efforts—while important—can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed. The statement provides best practices using NIST’s Risk Management Framework, the CIA triad, and OMB Circular A-137 to guide secure, responsible data sharing.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Risk communication and public outreach
- Understanding of cybersecurity frameworks and standards
- Government-focused risk analysis and safeguards
- Technical writing tailored for a non-technical audience
- Real-world breach and open data scenario analysis

This work strengthens my ability to communicate cybersecurity risks and solutions clearly to business leaders, government stakeholders, and the public—an essential skill in GRC and cybersecurity compliance roles.
