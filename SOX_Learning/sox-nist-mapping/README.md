# SOX + NIST 800-53 Control Mapping Demo

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how IT General Controls (ITGCs) relevant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) can be aligned with security controls from the NIST SP 800-53 framework. It is designed as a hands-on learning exercise to help build foundational knowledge in IT compliance, internal controls, and control mapping.

The project simulates the type of documentation that a compliance analyst or IT auditor might create to assist with control alignment, audit readiness, or gap analysis activities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand the purpose of SOX ITGCs and how they relate to financial reporting controls.
- Explore how NIST SP 800-53 controls can support SOX compliance.
- Practice documenting and mapping internal controls using a mock control matrix.
