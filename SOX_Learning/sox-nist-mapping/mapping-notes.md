# Mapping Notes

## üìù Assumptions

- This mapping assumes a simplified SOX environment focused on IT General Controls (ITGCs) related to access control, change management, and data integrity.
- NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 was used as the control source. Not all controls are required for SOX, so I focused on a subset that logically supports ITGC objectives.
- The mappings are conceptual‚Äîintended to demonstrate relationships between frameworks, not actual compliance coverage.

---

## üîç Selection Criteria

- Chose NIST controls that directly support:
  - Logical access restrictions (e.g., AC-2, AC-6)
  - System development and change control (e.g., CM-3, CM-4)
  - Backup and recovery (e.g., CP-9, CP-10)
  - Audit logging and monitoring (e.g., AU-2, AU-6)

## üìä Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **Challenge**: There‚Äôs no 1:1 mapping between SOX and NIST‚ÄîSOX is focused on financial reporting risks, while NIST covers broader information system security.
- **Lesson**: Control mapping requires understanding both intent and implementation. A single NIST control may support multiple SOX objectives.
- **Takeaway**: Even if two frameworks use different language, they often support similar goals. Clear documentation helps make those connections.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Expand the matrix to include control implementation examples.
- Explore mapping other frameworks like COBIT, ISO 27001, or COSO.
- Practice writing basic control descriptions or test procedures for selected controls.
