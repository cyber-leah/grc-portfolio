## 🎯 Purpose

This guide is designed to:
- Build foundational knowledge of software supply chain risks
- Translate key recommendations into actionable concepts
- Map CISA guidance to NIST SP 800-53 and NIST CSF controls
- Support my learning path in GRC, vendor risk, and cybersecurity frameworks

## 📘 Contents

- `study-guide.md`: Section-by-section breakdown of the CISA document
- `cisa-to-nist-crosswalk.md` *(coming soon)*: Mapping CISA guidance to related NIST 800-53 controls
- Visuals and checklists to help reinforce the material (in progress)

## 💡 Use Case

This project is part of my cybersecurity and GRC portfolio. It demonstrates how I:
- Analyze and digest government cybersecurity publications
- Connect real-world risks to control frameworks
- Think critically about improving software supply chain defenses
