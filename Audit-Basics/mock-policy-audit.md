## 🧪 Mock Internal Audit Example: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Review

**Scenario:**  
You are performing an internal cybersecurity audit for a small tech company with 50 employees. As part of the audit, you're reviewing their **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** to evaluate whether it aligns with organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

---

### 📌 Audit Objective

Determine if the organization's Acceptable Use Policy:

- Exists and is accessible
- Defines proper and improper use of IT resources
- Covers employee responsibilities for data protection
- Aligns with compliance obligations (e.g., NIST 800-53 AC-1, ISO 27001 A.6.2.1)
- Is regularly reviewed and updated

### 🔎 Sample Audit Steps

| Step | Task | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Locate and obtain a copy of the AUP | Found in HR SharePoint under “Policies” |
| 2 | Verify approval and review dates | Last reviewed 2 years ago—outdated |
| 3 | Check if it defines acceptable/unacceptable behaviors | ✅ Covered clearly |
| 4 | Check alignment with security awareness training | ❌ Not referenced |
| 5 | Compare against NIST 800-53 AC-1 & ISO 27001 A.6.2.1 | ✳️ Partial alignment (missing guidance on remote work) |
| 6 | Interview HR or policy owner for clarification | HR confirms no update process in place |

---

### 📋 Findings & Recommendations

| Finding | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| AUP is outdated (last reviewed 2 years ago) | Medium | Establish annual policy review cycle |
| Missing remote work guidance | Medium | Update AUP to include remote access, BYOD, and home network use |
| No mention of security training alignment | Low | Reference training policy and link to awareness program |
