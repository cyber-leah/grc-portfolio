## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Audit Basics

This section of my GRC learning portfolio introduces the fundamentals of cybersecurity auditing—an essential component of risk and compliance. Cybersecurity audits evaluate how effectively an organization adheres to its security policies, controls, and regulatory obligations.

### ✅ Overview

**What is a Cybersecurity Audit?**  
A formal evaluation of an organization’s information systems to determine the adequacy of security controls, policies, and procedures.

**Why It Matters:**
- Identifies vulnerabilities and compliance gaps  
- Improves security posture  
- Supports regulatory and contractual obligations (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST, ISO 27001)

### 🔍 Types of Cybersecurity Audits

| Audit Type         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Internal Audit** | Conducted by the organization to self-check risks and control effectiveness |
| **External Audit** | Performed by a third party (e.g., for certification or client assurance) |
| **Compliance Audit** | Checks adherence to frameworks or laws (e.g., NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2) |
| **Technical Audit** | Reviews systems, configurations, logs, and codebases for technical risks |

### 🧰 Key Audit Components

- **Scope Definition**  
  What systems, departments, or processes will be audited?

- **Audit Criteria**  
  What standards or frameworks will be used (NIST, ISO, CIS Controls)?

- **Data Collection Methods**  
  Interviews, documentation reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scans

- **Risk Assessment & Gap Analysis**  
  Identify areas where current practices fall short of standards

- **Reporting & Recommendations**  
  Clear, actionable findings mapped to risks and controls

### 📋 Sample Audit Checklist

Here’s a basic example of items that might be reviewed:

- ✅ Is there a formal Information Security Policy?
- ✅ Are user access controls enforced?
- ✅ Are critical systems patched regularly?
- ✅ Are backups tested and validated?
- ✅ Is logging and monitoring in place?
- ✅ Are incident response procedures documented?
