This is a continuation of my GitHub GRC portfolio project and I want to pick up where we left off, starting the Cybersecurit audit basics for my github page.

Perfect, Leah! Let‚Äôs dive into Cybersecurity Audit Basics for your GitHub GRC portfolio.

Here‚Äôs a suggested outline to kick things off with a solid foundation and room to grow:

üìÇ cybersecurity-audit-basics/README.md
üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Audit Basics
This section of my GRC learning portfolio introduces the fundamentals of cybersecurity auditing‚Äîan essential component of risk and compliance. Cybersecurity audits evaluate how effectively an organization adheres to its security policies, controls, and regulatory obligations.

‚úÖ Overview
What is a Cybersecurity Audit?
A formal evaluation of an organization‚Äôs information systems to determine the adequacy of security controls, policies, and procedures.

Why It Matters:

Identifies vulnerabilities and compliance gaps

Improves security posture

Supports regulatory and contractual obligations (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST, ISO 27001)

üîç Types of Cybersecurity Audits
Audit Type	Description
Internal Audit	Conducted by the organization to self-check risks and control effectiveness
External Audit	Performed by a third party (e.g., for certification or client assurance)
Compliance Audit	Checks adherence to frameworks or laws (e.g., NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2)
Technical Audit	Reviews systems, configurations, logs, and codebases for technical risks
üß∞ Key Audit Components
Scope Definition
What systems, departments, or processes will be audited?

Audit Criteria
What standards or frameworks will be used (NIST, ISO, CIS Controls)?

Data Collection Methods
Interviews, documentation reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scans

Risk Assessment & Gap Analysis
Identify areas where current practices fall short of standards

Reporting & Recommendations
Clear, actionable findings mapped to risks and controls

üìã Sample Audit Checklist
Here‚Äôs a basic example of items that might be reviewed:

‚úÖ Is there a formal Information Security Policy?

‚úÖ Are user access controls enforced?

‚úÖ Are critical systems patched regularly?

‚úÖ Are backups tested and validated?

‚úÖ Is logging and monitoring in place?

‚úÖ Are incident response procedures documented?

Would you like me to go ahead and generate this structure on a README.md file for your GitHub page? And do you want to include any tools or screenshots to show a mock audit example or checklist as part of this section?

You said:
yes, please! This will help me with my learning also!

Done! I‚Äôve added a new Cybersecurity Audit Basics markdown page to your GitHub GRC project. Next up, we can:

Add a mock audit example (e.g., small company scenario, simple policy review).

Create a downloadable checklist template (CSV or markdown table).

Include screenshots or diagrams (if you're using audit tools or frameworks).

Want to move on to one of those now?
