## Introduction

Bay & Shore General Store, a coastal retailer known for themed home goods and locally sourced confections, is preparing to expand into e-commerce. With a decline in physical store visits and an increase in remote orders, establishing an online presence is essential. However, the shift to digital introduces a variety of cyber and IT risks.

This analysis evaluates those risks through the lens of cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), particularly focusing on PCI DSS, insider threats, and data protection. Recommendations are provided to help Bay & Shore safeguard its operations and customer trust.

## E-Commerce Industry Overview

E-commerce has become central to consumer behavior, particularly post-COVID. With this convenience comes responsibility—especially around secure payment processing.

- **Securing the Network**
- **Protecting Account Data**
- **Vulnerability Management**
- **Access Control Measures**
- **Monitoring and Testing**
- **Information Security Policy**

- Cybersecurity needs

All three companies emphasized the importance of:
- Protecting customer payment data
- Managing third-party and supply chain risks

Focus on the most probable and high-impact risks first, to efficiently allocate resources.

Regular assessments will help identify and close security gaps before exploitation occurs.

### 3. Regulatory Compliance
Comply with **PCI DSS** and other relevant data protection standards to maintain trust and legality.

Implement continuous monitoring tools to detect fraud and attack attempts early.

### 5. Strong Policies and Procedures
Establish clear data handling and security protocols, including encryption standards.

### 6. Security Awareness Training
Educate employees on phishing, social engineering, and data protection practices.

### 7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Ensure employees only access data and tools necessary for their role to reduce insider risk.

## Risk Treatment Approaches

- **Accept**: Some risk (e.g., residual card theft) may be tolerated with proper monitoring.
- **Avoid**: Don’t store payment data unless properly encrypted.
- **Mitigate**: Train employees and build secure systems to reduce the likelihood and impact of attacks.
- **Transfer**: Use cyber liability insurance to offset financial impacts from breaches.

## Conclusion

Bay & Shore is poised to grow through e-commerce but must address cybersecurity risks head-on. With a solid GRC strategy—including PCI DSS compliance, risk assessments, and employee training—the company can protect its assets, its customers, and its reputation.
