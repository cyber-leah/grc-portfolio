## 👋 Introduction

Hello everyone, thank you for joining to hear about today's topic: **The Business Need for Cybersecurity**.

Cyberattacks are becoming more frequent and increasingly sophisticated. A single successful attack can lead to devastating consequences — exposing sensitive data, disrupting operations, and even disabling infrastructure. In extreme cases, cyberattacks may also cause physical harm (Pratt, 2024, para. 3).

A recent incident that illustrates the urgency of strong cybersecurity is the **MOVEit data breach**. By examining this breach, we can better understand cybersecurity’s critical role in protecting business operations, sensitive data, and organizational trust in today’s digital world.

## 🕵️ MOVEit Data Breach: A Case Study

In **May 2023**, the MOVEit data breach began when the cybercriminal group **Clop** exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit’s file transfer software. Major organizations such as Shell, British Airways, and the U.S. Department of Energy were among the affected.

What’s more troubling is that even companies that **did not directly use MOVEit** were impacted through their third-party vendors (Newman & Burgess, 2023, para. 2). Over **62 million individuals** were affected across the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Germany.

This breach emphasizes how interconnected and vulnerable today’s digital ecosystems can be — and why companies like **Silverpine Security** must prioritize cybersecurity.

## 🛠️ Three Key Issues Revealed

### 1. **Vendor Risk**

Many organizations were compromised because their **vendors** used MOVEit. This demonstrates why every company must assess and monitor **third-party security risks** through a well-defined vendor risk management program.

### 2. **Sensitive Data Protection**

The MOVEit attack exposed personal and confidential data, underscoring the need for strong **data protection policies and controls**. Beyond fines, data breaches lead to **customer distrust and reputational damage**.

### 3. **Incident Preparedness**

Although the MOVEit vulnerability was patched, the damage was done. This illustrates the need for businesses to have strong **incident response plans**, regular security assessments, and proactive patch management in place.
