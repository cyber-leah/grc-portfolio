## Introduction

This briefing quickly explains how FedRAMP helps agencies ensure the security of digital government services. It covers what digital government services are, how FedRAMP works, and how both FedRAMP and Play #11 from the Federal CIO Council’s Digital Services Playbook contribute to privacy and security improvements.

## What Are Digital Government Services?

Digital government services (formerly known as e-government, per the Electronic Government Act of 2002) use internet-based technologies to improve how the government delivers services and shares information with citizens and agencies.

According to the USDA, these services use web-based apps or IT solutions to increase access, effectiveness, and quality (USDA, n.d.). Because these platforms often involve sensitive personal data and critical systems, securing them is a top priority.

## What Is FedRAMP and How Is It Used?

**FedRAMP** (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) is a government-wide framework that standardizes the security assessment and authorization of cloud products used by federal agencies. It supports FISMA compliance and aligns with NIST cybersecurity standards (FedRAMP, 2024).

### Key Benefits:
- **Reusable Authorizations:** Saves time and money by allowing agencies to reuse cloud service approvals.
- **Accelerated Cloud Adoption:** Supports secure delivery of cloud-based services.
- **Ongoing Oversight:** Encourages continuous monitoring, technical guidance, and risk mitigation.

In FY2024 alone, agencies reused FedRAMP-authorized cloud services over **2,000 times**, highlighting its scalability and trust. The new **20x initiative** seeks to automate and modularize compliance processes, further enhancing security and speed (FedRAMP, 2025).

## The Role of Play #11 in Privacy and Security

**Play #11** of the [Federal Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.usds.gov/#play11) advises agencies to integrate security and privacy from the start—not as afterthoughts. It encourages:

- Reviewing legal/privacy requirements early
- Using FedRAMP-certified infrastructure
- Automating secure configurations (e.g., deployment scripts)

### Key Questions Encourage Agencies to Ask:
- Are users notified when data is collected?
- Are we collecting more than necessary?
- Can users view, access, or correct their data?

These practices align with **“secure by design”** principles and support long-term manageability and compliance.

## Final Thoughts

FedRAMP and Play #11 work in tandem to support secure, privacy-aware digital government services. Standardized authorization and built-in privacy safeguards help protect sensitive data, strengthen public trust, and meet evolving federal security requirements.
