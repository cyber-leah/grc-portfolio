## Introduction

While privacy is often viewed as a deeply personal value, it’s frequently exchanged for convenience in the digital age—sometimes without full awareness of the risks. The federal government has a responsibility to safeguard the personally identifiable information (PII) it collects, ensuring public trust is preserved.

This briefing highlights best practices for protecting personal data, explains the value of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), and reviews the legal foundations and benefits of these processes.

## What Is Privacy?

At its core, privacy is an individual’s ability to control how their personal information is handled. However, privacy is complex—both legally and conceptually.

In **Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)**, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed an implied constitutional right to privacy, later expanded through other cases like **Eisenstadt v. Baird** and **Lawrence v. Texas** (LII, n.d.).

Privacy is often broken into **four categories**:
- **Information privacy** – protection of PII
- **Bodily privacy** – autonomy over one’s body
- **Territorial privacy** – personal space, home, or work environment
- **Communications privacy** – confidentiality of conversations

Understanding these helps frame how privacy risks are assessed in government systems and where individual expectations may exceed legal safeguards.

## Best Practices for Protecting Privacy

The **Government Accountability Office (GAO)** identifies practical strategies to enhance privacy protections:

- **Conduct early privacy risk assessments**  
  Anticipating vulnerabilities during system development builds privacy into the foundation.

- **Strengthen information security programs**  
  Regular audits, updated policies, and employee training are vital to protect PII.

- **Limit data collection and retention**  
  Only collect what’s needed, and retain it for as short a time as necessary.

- **Apply encryption and access control**  
  Secure PII in transit and at rest, using role-based access to prevent misuse (GAO, 2012).

## Why Are PIAs Necessary?

PIAs are required under:
- **Section 208** of the **E-Government Act of 2002**
- **Section 222** of the **Homeland Security Act**

They ensure that systems collecting or handling PII undergo a structured privacy risk assessment. **OMB guidance (2003)** explains how and when PIAs must be conducted.

Agencies must perform a PIA for any new or significantly modified system that collects PII—helping assess privacy impacts early and maintain transparency throughout the system's life cycle.

## Benefits of PIAs

PIAs support responsible data use by:
- **Minimizing intrusiveness** – Ensuring only necessary data is collected
- **Promoting fairness** – Increasing transparency in how data is used
- **Reinforcing confidentiality expectations** – Setting clear standards for protection

These goals help build public confidence in digital services and align federal practices with citizen expectations of privacy (DHS, 2007).

## Summary

This briefing reviewed how the federal government protects privacy through legal precedent, best practices, and the use of Privacy Impact Assessments. Key takeaways include:

- Understanding four categories of privacy
- Using early assessments and encryption to reduce risk
- Leveraging PIAs to increase fairness, transparency, and trust

By applying these strategies, agencies show a commitment to privacy and accountability in federal IT systems.
