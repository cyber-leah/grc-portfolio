# ðŸ“‹ Sample Risk Assessment Outline (Based on NIST SP 800-30)

> As seen in Appendix N of the CAP CBK (2nd ed.) â€” useful for supporting Chapter 3: Select Security Controls

## Executive Summary

### I. Introduction
- **Purpose**
- **Scope**
- **System Description**  
  Describe system components, users, field site locations (if any), and other details relevant to the assessment.

### II. Risk Assessment Approach
- **Project Participants**
- **Methods for Information Gathering** (e.g., interviews, tools, questionnaires)
- **Methodology for Identifying and Pairing Threats/Vulnerabilities**  
  Also include risk ranking methods and approaches for specifying mitigating controls.

## Risk Assessment Content

### III. System Characterization
- Describe hardware (e.g., servers, routers), software (e.g., apps, OS), interfaces, protocols, users.
- Include connectivity diagrams or input/output flowcharts to define system scope.

### IV. Threat Statement
- List potential threats and associated actions that could affect the system.

### V. Risk Assessment Results
- **Findings with Cross-Reference Numbers**
- **Discussion of Each Threat/Vulnerability Pair**
- **Likelihood of Occurrence** (High / Medium / Low)
- **Impact Evaluation** (High / Medium / Low)
- **Risk Rating** based on matrix
- **Recommended Controls or Alternatives**

---

## VI. Summary
- Provide a concise report of findings and summarize:
  - Risk levels
  - Control recommendations
  - Comments to aid understanding
