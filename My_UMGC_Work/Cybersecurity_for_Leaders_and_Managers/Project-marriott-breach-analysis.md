## üìò Introduction

Cybersecurity breaches continue to rise across all industries, and organizations that handle sensitive information must implement strong safeguards. A recent audit by Silverpine Security‚Äôs cyber insurer identified major gaps in breach preparedness, resulting in a warning: the cyber insurance policy will not be renewed unless a corrective plan is established.

This report analyzes the **Marriott data breach**, including its root causes, consequences, and missed opportunities. The lessons learned are used to develop **best practices** Silverpine can adopt to strengthen its cybersecurity posture and meet compliance and insurance requirements.

## üîç Case Study: The Marriott Data Breach

### Background

When Marriott International acquired **Starwood Hotels** in 2016, it unknowingly inherited an ongoing breach that originated in 2014. The breach was not discovered until 2018, exposing Marriott to massive reputational, legal, and financial consequences (Tidy, 2020).

## üß† Impact of Lost Confidentiality

### Effect on Customers

According to Gressin (2018), up to **500 million individuals** were affected. Stolen information included:

- Full names and addresses  
- Passport numbers and birth dates  
- Loyalty program accounts  
- Reservation and travel data  

Victims were vulnerable to identity theft, financial fraud, and targeted social engineering attacks (Burke, 2020).

### Effect on Marriott

The breach caused:

- Over **5% drop in share value** (Newsome, 2019)  
- Intent to fine Marriott **$123 million** by the UK's ICO  
- Legal exposure under GDPR and other privacy laws  
- Potential liabilities and settlements up to **$200 million** (Clark, 2018)

The incident highlights the devastating cost of **insufficient due diligence**, both financially and reputationally.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Government & Legal Findings

The **UK Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO)** stated that Marriott:

- Failed to prevent "unlawful processing" of personal data  
- Did not apply proper **technical and organizational controls**  
- Breached key GDPR principles (ICO, 2020)

Multiple **class-action lawsuits** followed, including one seeking $12.5 billion in damages (Young, 2021). These findings highlight the legal risk posed by **poor third-party risk management** during mergers and acquisitions.

## ‚úÖ Best Practice Recommendations

To mitigate similar risks, Silverpine Security should strengthen its security posture using best practices across four key areas:

---

### üë• People

- **Mandatory Security Awareness Training**  
  Train employees to recognize phishing, insider threats, and data handling policies.

- **Dedicated Incident Response Team**  
  Assign trained personnel to respond to and investigate security events quickly.

---

### üîÑ Processes

- **Adopt a Security Framework**  
  Implement NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53, or align with GDPR.

- **Develop a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Strategy**  
  Monitor, detect, and block unauthorized data exfiltration.

---

### üìú Policies

- **Strong Password Policy with MFA**  
  Require frequent password changes, unique credentials, and multi-factor authentication.

- **Data Retention & Destruction Policy**  
  Limit unnecessary data storage and securely dispose of unneeded information.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Data Encryption (At Rest & In Transit)**  
  Protect high-risk data from unauthorized access.

- **Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)**  
  Monitor real-time logs and provide alerts to the SOC for analysis and response.

---

## üßæ Summary

The Marriott breach shows the importance of proactive cybersecurity planning, especially during acquisitions. For Silverpine Security to retain its cyber insurance and avoid similar consequences, it must:

- Implement strong policies and procedures  
- Train employees at all levels  
- Leverage tools like encryption, DLP, and SIEM  
- Align with industry-standard security frameworks

These steps will demonstrate to Silverpine‚Äôs insurer that the company is equipped to **prevent, detect, and respond to data breaches** ‚Äî and protect its customers, reputation, and future.
