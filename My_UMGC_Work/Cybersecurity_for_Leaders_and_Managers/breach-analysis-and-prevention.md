## 🔍 Overview

The MGM Resorts breach that occurred in **late 2023** stood out to me — not only because of its impact, but because it mirrored a major incident that had already happened in **2019**. Back then, MGM experienced a data breach that compromised customer information, exposing personal details of millions of guests (Robles, 2023).

In 2023, history repeated itself. This time, the breach was carried out through **social engineering** and **phishing**, tactics that continue to be alarmingly effective — even at large companies with significant security budgets.

## 🎭 The Attack: Social Engineering and Human Weakness

The 2023 attackers, identified as the threat group **Scattered Spider**, used strategic reconnaissance to study employees’ **social media activity** and digital footprint. By impersonating staff members convincingly, they were able to **trick the helpdesk** into resetting credentials — a textbook case of social engineering (Srivastava et al., 2023).

This wasn't a technical vulnerability — it was a human one.

## 🧠 What Could Be Done Differently?

In my opinion, this breach highlights an urgent need for **better employee awareness training**, especially around:

- The dangers of **oversharing on social media**
- How social engineering attacks are **staged and executed**
- The importance of **verifying identity before resetting credentials**
- How **phishing** and voice-based fraud can be disguised as internal requests

Companies should also review their **internal policies and helpdesk procedures**, especially those related to authentication for access resets or sensitive requests.

## 💡 Recommendations

To prevent similar breaches in the future, organizations should:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Implement tailored cybersecurity awareness training** with real-world examples (like this breach)
- 🔐 **Train staff to lock down their social media accounts** and limit exposure to personal/workplace info
- 📋 **Reinforce identity verification policies** before performing account changes
- 🛡️ **Leverage security technologies** such as adaptive MFA and helpdesk access control systems
- 🔄 **Continuously update procedures** in response to new attack techniques

Awareness is not a one-time event — it must be **ongoing, evolving, and realistic** to be effective.

---

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

The MGM breach is a powerful reminder that even large companies with past breaches are still vulnerable if **humans remain the weakest link**. Technical solutions must be paired with **security culture** — and that starts with awareness, education, and empowerment.
