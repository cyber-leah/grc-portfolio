## Purpose

This memo aims to inform management of potential vulnerabilities in two IoT devices currently in use at **WakeMed Health and Hospitals**: the **Toshiba Multi-Function Peripheral (MFP)** and the **Zebra GK420d label printer**. It includes an overview of each device, a summary of the related Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), risk implications, and recommendations regarding continued use or replacement.

## Device 1: Toshiba Multi-Function Peripheral (MFP)

### Overview

The Toshiba MFP is a multifunction office device that prints, scans, copies, and faxes documents. It features a touchscreen interface and supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. It is capable of connecting via wireless LAN and Bluetooth ([Toshiba.com](https://www.toshiba.com/)).

### Vulnerability – CVE-2024-27169

- **Base Score:** 8.4 (High)  
- **Type:** Authentication vulnerability  
- **Attack Vector:** Local  
- **Impact:**  
  - Grants unauthorized administrative access via insecure API authorization  
  - High risk to confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data  
  - Potential for data modification and business disruption ([NIST-NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27169))

### Resolution

Toshiba has released a **firmware update** to resolve this issue and recommends the following **workarounds**:
- Operate the MFP strictly within the protected internal network  
- Use **IP address filtering** to restrict access  
- Limit physical access to the device’s connected network ([Available Solutions](https://www.toshiba.com/solutions))

### Recommendation

Given Toshiba's swift action and the availability of both a patch and mitigations, it is recommended that WakeMed **continue using the Toshiba MFP**, with the firmware patch applied and protective configurations enforced.

## Device 2: Zebra GK420d Label Printer

### Overview

The Zebra GK420d is a thermal printer used for producing barcodes and labels for tracking equipment and transfers within healthcare environments. It is connected via USB or Ethernet and does not use ink, making it low-maintenance and cost-effective ([Zebra.com](https://www.zebra.com/)).

### Vulnerability – CVE-2024-3125

- **Base Score:** 2.4 (Low)  
- **Type:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)  
- **Attack Vector:** Remote  
- **Impact:**  
  - Allows scripts to be run in the user’s browser  
  - Risk of **data theft or session hijacking**  
  - Low complexity, but potential for exploitation remains ([NIST-NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3125))

### Resolution

Zebra has **not responded** to reports of this vulnerability. No official patch or mitigation has been released. As a temporary solution, using a **web application firewall** (WAF) may help detect and block exploit attempts, but it is unlikely to cover all attack vectors ([CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/)).

### Recommendation

Due to Zebra’s **lack of response** and the absence of a vendor-provided solution, it is strongly recommended that WakeMed:
- Implement a WAF immediately  
- Provide awareness training for staff on phishing and script-based attacks  
- **Replace the Zebra GK420d printer** with a secure alternative from a more responsive vendor

## Summary of Recommendations

| Device          | Status         | Recommendation                               |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Toshiba MFP** | Patch available | Continue use with updates + mitigations      |
| **Zebra GK420d**| No fix issued   | Discontinue use and replace when possible    |
