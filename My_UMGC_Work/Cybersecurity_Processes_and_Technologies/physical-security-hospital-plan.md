# 🏥 Physical Security Plan for a Regional Hospital

> _This document summarizes physical security and cyber hygiene measures based on a hospital layout diagram, including perimeter protection, visitor management, maternity ward safeguards, and HIPAA-focused training._

---

## 🛡️ Exterior Security

- **Lighting**: Installed at all vehicular entry points, hospital entrances, pedestrian walkways, and around the perimeter to increase visibility and deter criminal activity.
- **Visitor vs. Staff Parking**:  
  - Visitor parking is open and well-lit.  
  - Staff parking includes **access control** via a guard post and fencing to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Surveillance**: Security cameras are placed at all building entrances, in staff/visitor parking areas, and along entry/exit points for real-time monitoring and video evidence.

## 🏢 Lobby Controls

- **Reinforced Windows**: Blunt-force resistant, shatterproof windows help protect from both environmental damage and physical intrusion attempts (Campbell, 2022).
- **Visitor Check-In**:  
  - Non-employees must provide name, purpose of visit, and whether they’re carrying weapons.  
  - Patients must show a **photo ID**.
- **Access Control at Doors**:  
  - Main entrance includes **security guard, metal detector, and ID distribution**.  
  - Side door (staff entry) has signage and a security guard to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Cameras cover all doors for continuous monitoring.

## 👶 Maternity Unit Safeguards

- **Nurses’ Station**: Centrally positioned for full view of entry/exit point.  
- **Access Restrictions**:  
  - Visitors are kept in designated zones with signage or maps.  
  - Nursery door remains locked and monitored by security personnel.
- **Infant Safety Measures**:  
  - Staff are trained to identify suspicious individuals and avoid disclosing sensitive information (Miller, 2007).  
  - **Matching ID bands** placed on mother and infant at birth with secure identifiers (name, date/time, patient ID).
  - **Secondary ID badges** for maternity unit staff reduce unnecessary traffic and enhance access control.

## 🧠 Security & HIPAA Training

- **Awareness Training**: Required for all staff to reduce PHI exposure and avoid fines or breaches (McDade, 2024).
- **Role-Based Training**:  
  - Medical staff: Basics of cybersecurity, phishing awareness  
  - IT staff: Advanced security knowledge for threat detection
- **Training Cadence**:  
  - **General awareness and HIPAA training** completed regularly  
  - **Role-specific training** administered routinely based on job function
