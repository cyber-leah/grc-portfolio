## Why the Business Needs OPSEC

The business needs Operational Security (OPSEC) to help leaders proactively identify where critical information might be vulnerable to compromise. OPSEC involves:

1. Identifying critical information  
2. Recognizing potential threats  
3. Analyzing vulnerabilities  
4. Assessing risk levels  
5. Implementing countermeasures  

This structured process improves the organization’s ability to protect its most sensitive operations and assets (Zhang, n.d.).

## Identifying Critical Information

Critical information falls into two key categories:

### 1. Telemetry Links Data

- **Command and control data**: Sent from the Test Range to the Test Vehicle and stored at the R&D Center.
- **Sensor data**: Reflects the vehicle's status and response capabilities; sent back to the R&D Center.
- **Housekeeping data**: Archived test data — although not actively used, it still contains sensitive details.
- **Debugging data**: Stored at the R&D Center and includes error correction logs used during testing.

### 2. Voice and Data Communications

- **Voice transmissions**: Cellular phone and command methods between test areas. If compromised, they can result in miscommunication or delay (Barker, 2003).
- **Test data**: Includes video, images, and results — all of which are transmitted between the Test Range and the R&D Center and must be protected.

## Potential Threats at the Test Range

OPSEC helps reduce exposure to the following risks:

### 🔓 Interception
Bad actors can intercept command, control, and RF transmissions using various methods:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks**
- **Eavesdropping**
- **Malicious command injection**

This threatens the **confidentiality and integrity** of sensitive testing data (DeLaOsa, 2017).

### 🛠 Unauthorized Modifications
Telemetry Links can be targeted to:
- Disrupt communication
- Modify or falsify data
- Trigger **vehicle malfunction** or **safety incidents**

### 🌐 Internet Vulnerabilities
Online threats include:
- Malware
- Hacking
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks

These can result in unauthorized access or render systems unavailable during critical operations.
