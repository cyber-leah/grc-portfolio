## Introduction

Investing in **Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)** is a smart and strategic move for any organization looking to reduce the risk of insider threats. IGA helps ensure that employees have the **right access to the right resources at the right time** — and only for valid business reasons. In particular, an IGA solution can support the organization in the following three ways:

1. Preventing intellectual property (IP) loss with **role-based access control (RBAC)**
2. Enabling **safe data handling** through classification and ownership
3. Strengthening **user lifecycle management** with automation

## 1. Mitigating Intellectual Property Loss with RBAC

To reduce the risk of insider threats, organizations can implement **RBAC**, which restricts access to resources based on job roles. For example, employees in accounting should not have access to engineering plans or client development environments. RBAC supports core security principles such as **least privilege** and **separation of duties**.

Omada (2024) explains that IGA systems allow businesses to automate access permissions by considering factors like job function and identity attributes. This automation reduces manual errors, improves efficiency, and ensures access rights remain aligned with employee roles — helping to keep IP and sensitive data protected.

## 2. Promoting Safe Data Handling with Classification & Ownership

A strong insider threat defense also depends on **how data is labeled and managed**. IGA tools can help organizations define data sensitivity levels — such as Public, Confidential, or Restricted — and assign **data owners** who are responsible for its accuracy and access control.

According to IBM's 2019 *Cost of a Data Breach Report*, 24% of data breaches were due to **employee or contractor negligence**, while 51% were caused by malicious actions (Arampatzis, 2019). This reinforces the need for structured data governance — and IGA plays a key role in enforcing policies that limit improper data access or misuse.

## 3. Enhancing User Lifecycle Management

Without the right systems, managing user access as employees **join, leave, or change roles** can lead to excessive or lingering access — a major security concern. IGA solutions automate key parts of the **user lifecycle**, including onboarding, role reassignment, and offboarding.

Nayak (2023) points out that this automation minimizes the risk of **orphaned accounts** (from departed employees) and **overprovisioned accounts** (where users have access beyond their role). This not only improves security but also simplifies audits and compliance efforts.

---

## Conclusion

An effective IGA solution is more than a convenience — it’s a vital component of modern cybersecurity. By automating role-based access, supporting safe data handling, and managing user accounts efficiently, IGA can dramatically reduce the risk of insider threats. For any organization concerned about protecting its people, processes, and data, IGA is a worthwhile investment.
