## Why a SOCC Matters

A well-established **Security Operations and Control Center (SOCC)** — also referred to as a SOC — is a critical asset for any organization aiming to strengthen its cybersecurity posture. The SOC plays a central role in:

- Monitoring systems for threats
- Detecting and containing attacks
- Supporting eradication and recovery
- Enhancing resilience through ongoing review

This document presents best practices mapped to the **four phases of the incident response process**: **Detection**, **Containment**, **Eradication**, and **Recovery**.

---

## 🔎 Incident Detection

Detection best practices focus on identifying indicators of compromise (IOC) early to mitigate cyber risks:

- **Continuous monitoring** via tools like **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** helps detect threats in real time while improving alert management (IBM, 2023).
- **Threat intelligence** feeds provide up-to-date information on known vulnerabilities and emerging threats (Cichonski et al., 2012).
- **Machine learning** enhances detection accuracy and helps predict attacker behavior (Cherian, 2023).
- **Regular penetration testing** identifies exploitable weaknesses before attackers do.

## 🚫 Containment

Containment strategies are designed to **minimize damage** once a threat is detected:

- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** can quickly flag anomalies based on deviations from typical behavior (Manage Engine, n.d.).
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** tools isolate threats that bypass preventive defenses (Manage Engine, n.d.).
- Keep **incident playbooks** up to date to allow SOC teams to respond quickly and consistently.

---

## 🧹 Eradication

Eradication ensures that threats are fully removed and can’t return later:

- Perform a **thorough root cause investigation** to understand how the attack occurred.
- **Patch all affected systems** with the latest security updates.
- Use **automated threat removal** features in EDR platforms to eliminate malware traces (IBM, 2022).

---

## 🔄 Recovery

A structured recovery process ensures business continuity with minimal disruption:

- **Cybersecurity awareness training** equips teams to prevent recurrence and improve tool usage.
- Continuously **evaluate SOC performance** and adjust tactics or tools as needed (Manage Engine, n.d.).
- **Harden endpoints** with new credentials and improved network defenses (Cichonski et al., 2012).
- Conduct **routine risk assessments** to detect ongoing vulnerabilities.
- Update the **incident response plan** based on lessons learned.

## 🎯 Role of the SOC

The **Security Operations Center** monitors and analyzes the organization’s security environment. Its core responsibilities include:

- Detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents
- Collaborating with incident response teams
- Using **historical data and threat intelligence** to identify early signs of attack (Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, 2023)
- Recognizing suspicious activity using **baseline traffic analysis**
- Minimizing damage and reducing data loss through **rapid response** (Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, 2023)
