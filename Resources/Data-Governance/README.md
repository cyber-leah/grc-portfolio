## ✨ Why This Matters

Data governance is where **security, privacy, risk, and business operations** meet. It’s not just about protecting data — it’s about:

- Knowing what data you have  
- Understanding its value and sensitivity  
- Applying the right policies and protections  
- Being transparent and accountable to users and regulators
