# 🛡️ Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Overview

**Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** refers to a set of regulations, procedures, and internal controls used by financial institutions and other regulated entities to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.

2. **Layering** – Obscuring the origin through complex transactions.
3. **Integration** – Reintroducing funds into the economy as legitimate assets.
